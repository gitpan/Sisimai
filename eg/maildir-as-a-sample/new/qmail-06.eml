Hi. This is the qmail-send program at example.co.jp.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

<kijitora@example.jp>:
192.0.2.135 does not like recipient.
Remote host said: 450 4.2.2 <kijitora@example.jp>... Mailbox Full
Giving up on 192.0.2.135.
I'm not going to try again; this message has been in the queue too long.
