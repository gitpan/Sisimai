Hi. This is the qmail-send program at mx4.example.jp.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

<kijitora@example.ne.jp>:
Sorry, no SMTP connection got far enough; most progress was RCPT TO response; remote host 192.0.2.32 said: 550 Unknown user kijitora@example.ne.jp
. (#5.5.0)
(Other MXes tried: 192.0.2.32 said 550 for RCPT TO response; 192.0.2.40 said 550 for RCPT TO response; 192.0.2.12 said 550 for RCPT TO response; 192.0.2.24 said 550 for RCPT TO response.)
